# VISTA: Visual Storytelling enhanced Aspects

### <div align="center"> Hansel Matthew, Soyeon Caren Han, and Josiah Poon.</div>

## Aspect Enhanced Visual Storytelling Dataset
We introduce **VISTA**, a **visual storytelling** dataset with new **nine storytelling aspects** capturing creativity, emotion, and narrative richness, and propose a new metric, **VISTAScore**. This framework evaluates aspect expressiveness through combined lexical and semantic scorers. Using LVLMs and human validation, VISTA yields over **59k high-quality stories**.


## Dataset Details
VISTA dataset contained 59,407 stories, split into training, validation, and test sets with a 60/20/20 split: 35,644 for training, 11,881 for validation, and 11,882 for testing. Each data split is exported as a single JSON file, where each story is formatted as a JSON object using the following structure.

```json

{
    "Story ID": {
        "aspect": "Enhanced Story Aspect",
        "story": "dataset story",
        "image source": ["Image filenames sourced from VIST"]
    },
},

```

## Storytelling Aspects
Nine storytelling aspects chosen from our development process to represent diverse yet meaningful variations in human storytelling preferences.
